Introduction
In semiconductor manufacturing, predicting yield outcomes is crucial for optimizing production and reducing costs. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast pass/fail outcomes, enabling proactive adjustments in the manufacturing pipeline.

Dataset
The analysis is based on the SECOM dataset, which contains 1,567 instances and 590 attributes representing various process metrics. Each instance is labeled as pass (1) or fail (-1), indicating the yield outcome.

Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Columns with a high percentage of missing values were removed. Remaining missing values were imputed using appropriate statistical methods.

Standardization: Features were standardized to ensure uniformity, crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand feature distributions and relationships. Due to the high dimensionality, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to visualize data patterns.

Feature Selection
Feature selection was performed to identify the most influential process metrics affecting yield. Techniques such as variance thresholding and recursive feature elimination were utilized to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Modeling
Various machine learning algorithms were applied, including:

Logistic Regression: For baseline performance.

Random Forest: To capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): For handling high-dimensional data.

Models were trained and validated using appropriate cross-validation techniques.

Evaluation
Model performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were analyzed to understand misclassification patterns.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting semiconductor manufacturing yields. Accurate prediction models can lead to significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction.
